Created by a team of 3 freshmen as part of school-wide "Hack Day" competition. Placed 2nd in the competition.

The product has two parts, an iOS app and a website, that interact through a Firebase server. The user chooses a photo from his/her phone via the app, which is then uploaded to the Firebase server and accessed through the website.

The idea was to be able to get a single photo from a phone to a computer quickly and easily without a cord.
